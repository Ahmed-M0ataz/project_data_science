## Project Steps

### 1. Data Import

- The dataset was imported, and the necessary libraries were used to manipulate and analyze the data.

### 2. Data Exploration

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to gain insights into the dataset.
- Descriptive statistics, data distribution, and data quality checks were conducted.

### 3. Data Analysis

- Correlations between different features and power consumption were analyzed.
- Patterns and trends in the data were identified.

### 4. Data Visualization

- Data visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps were created to illustrate findings from the analysis.

### 5. Machine Learning Model

- A machine learning model was developed to predict house power consumption.
- Features were selected and preprocessed as needed.
- Model evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) were used to assess model performance.

### 6. Model Tuning

- Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize the model's performance.
- Techniques like Grid Search Cross-Validation were used to find the best hyperparameters.
